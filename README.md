# Vibes

Experimental turn by turn navigation using haptic feedback for walking and cycling.

### Vibration < > Turn mapping.

It's described in [the vibrator module](lib/vibrator/index.ts). But the mapping right now is pretty simple.

If we represent `_` as a long vibration and `.` as a short one. And ` ` as a pause.

- Right turn: `_ .`
- Straight ahead: `_ . .`
- Left turn: `_ . . .`

- Arrive: `__`
- Depart: `__`
- Deviation: `_ _ _ _ _`
